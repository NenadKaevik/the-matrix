# Matrix Code Rain
Cool matrix code rain effect built with Canvas + JS + Electron

## Usage

Simply clone this repository on your local machine and run the following commands:

To install all dependencies run 

    npm install

To build the app run

    npm run electron:build

This will build the app into a folder inside your repository named *matrix-win32-x64*. To run the app open the newly created folder *matrix-win32-x64* after building the app and run **matrix.exe**.

To exit the app press ALT + F4. This will be fixed in the next update by pressing Esc button :)

Enjoy and remember
**There is no spoon**
