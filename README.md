## Usage

This will build the app into a folder inside your repository named *matrix-win32-x64*. To run the app open the newly created folder *matrix-win32-x64* after building the app and run **matrix.exe**.

To exit the app press ALT + F4. This will be fixed in the next update by pressing Esc button :)
